# <div align="center"> Description </div>
<div align="center"> I built a C# MVC application for Pierre's bakery where he can track the vendors that purchase baked goods from him and the orders that belong to the vendors. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## The following are the functionalities used:
<p>&nbsp;</p>

* A Vendor class:
  Includes properties for the vendor's name and description and a list of the orders that were made by the vendor.
* Order class:
  Includes properties for the title, the description, the price, and the date.
* The homepage of the app at the root path (localhost:5000/) will be a splash page welcoming Pierre and providing him with a link to a Vendors page.
* The vendors page will contain a link to a page presenting Pierre with a form he can fill out to create a new Vendor. After the form is submitted, the new Vendor object will be saved into a static List and Pierre will be routed back to the homepage.
* Pierre will be able to click a Vendor's name and go to a new page that will display all of that Vendor's orders.
* Pierre will be provided with a link to a page presenting him with a form to create a new Order for a particular Vendor.
